## 📊 **Project Overview**

Electricity demand forecasting helps utilities and industries plan energy supply, reduce blackouts, and optimize cost distribution. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict hourly demand using:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Time features (hour, day, month, year)

---

## 🔍 **Key Features**

* ✔️ Full end-to-end data science workflow
* ✔️ Clean and well-structured dataset
* ✔️ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* ✔️ Machine learning for demand prediction
* ✔️ Time-based and weather-based feature engineering
* ✔️ Visualized insights and model performance plots

## 🔬 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key insights explored:

* Trend patterns in electricity demand

* Correlation between temperature, humidity, and demand

* Daily & seasonal demand cycles

* Distribution of weather features


---

## 🧠 **Modeling Approach**

The project uses multiple ML regression models, including:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor

Models were evaluated using:

* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
